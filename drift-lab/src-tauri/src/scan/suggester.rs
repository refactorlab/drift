//! Per-finding LLM suggestion driver.
//!
//! Reads a saved scan's `summary.findings_top` + `immediate_fixes` +
//! `refactor_candidates`, opens the surrounding source window for each via
//! the `read_file_lines` tool, and asks the LLM for a specific code change.
//! One LLM round-trip per finding, streamed back to the UI as `scan://
//! suggestion` events.
//!
//! **Why no agent loop here**: the static analyzer already decided what
//! deserves attention. The LLM's only job is to translate one finding into
//! one concrete suggestion. There is no tool dispatch, no turn budget — just
//! `system prompt + finding context + code window → answer`. This keeps the
//! responsibilities aligned with what the user asked for: "the use of the
//! LLM is only to give the suggestion over the code … only on the summary
//! of the static analysis."
//!
//! **Per-finding invocation**: the UI exposes a "Study this" button per
//! finding row. Each click runs *one* finding end-to-end — there is no bulk
//! / "do them all" mode. The registry key is `(scan_id, index)` so the
//! user can study several findings concurrently (one stream per finding)
//! without one Stop click cancelling another.
//!
//! Streaming: each finding fires three event waves so the UI can render
//! suggestions live, OpenAI-chat-completions-style:
//!   1. `scan://suggestion-start` — row metadata, sent before the LLM stream
//!      opens so the UI shows the badges + a spinner immediately.
//!   2. `scan://suggestion-delta` — each non-empty text chunk from the
//!      provider stream, in order. The frontend appends to its accumulator.
//!   3. `scan://suggestion` — the final settled body. The frontend uses it to
//!      reconcile (in case any deltas were dropped) and clear the spinner.

    // 3. Final settled body. Even on a mid-stream cancel we emit this so the
    //    UI clears `isStreaming` on the row (otherwise the row's spinner
    //    would hang forever). The body is exactly what we captured — no
    //    "(stopped)" marker, the partial-diff renderer already conveys
    //    incompleteness by virtue of the parser not seeing a closing fence.
    //
    //    Persistence: BEFORE the wire emit, write the body to
    //    `~/.drift/scans/<scan_id>/code-suggestions/<index>.json` so a
    //    page reload re-hydrates the same content without re-running the
    //    model. Best-effort — a save failure logs but doesn't fail the
    //    stream; the UI already has the data via events, so a disk hiccup
    //    is recoverable on the next click. Empty buffers (cancel before
    //    any chunks landed) are skipped to avoid useless empty files.
