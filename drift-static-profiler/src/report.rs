        // top-N rows in the viewer showing the same fact dozens of
        // times.
        //
        // The fix is structural: a finding is a fact about a SYMBOL,
        // not a tree node. We do one final walk that keeps each
        // (SymbolId, FindingKind) on its FIRST occurrence and drops
        // it on subsequent appearances. `HashSet::insert` returns
        // true iff newly inserted — combined with `Vec::retain` this
        // gives O(N) dedup with no extra allocation per finding.
