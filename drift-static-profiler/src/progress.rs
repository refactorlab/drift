//! Progress reporting seam for the analysis pipeline.
//!
//! The CLI's `scan` / `analyze-root` commands can run for minutes on a
//! large monorepo. Without progress callbacks, the process appears to
//! hang. We solve this without coupling the library to a TTY writer or
//! a progress-bar crate: `Progress` is a small trait the orchestrator
//! calls at well-defined moments, and library consumers can plug in
//! either [`NullProgress`] (no output) or any custom implementation.
//!
//! The CLI's bar implementation lives next to `main.rs` and is wired
//! in only at the binary layer, so the library crate stays free of
//! terminal-output concerns.
//!
//! Design follows Open/Closed: new pipeline phases can call additional
//! methods on `Progress` (provide a default no-op body), and existing
//! consumers keep working without recompiling.
//!
//! Thread-safety: implementations are called from both the walker
//! callback (single-threaded today) and from inside rayon's parallel
//! parse loop, so the trait requires `Sync`. The implementations here
//! use atomics rather than mutexes to keep contention near zero — the
//! parse worker pool calls `parse_progress` on every file completion,
//! and we don't want that path to acquire any locks.

// The terminal progress UI (indicatif → console/libc) and its supporting
// atomics/Mutex/Instant are native-only. wasm builds use NullProgress.
